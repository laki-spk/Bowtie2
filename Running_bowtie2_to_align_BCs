#create or change BCref file as below: 
#    53931_81120@B06$MARCH1	AATGAGATGCCCACTATTACGGAAAGCTCA to 
#    >53931_81120@B06$MARCH1
#    AATGAGATGCCCACTATTACGGAAAGCTCA
# and save the file as my_sequences.fasta

#Alternatively you can do it by runnign following command
cd /temp_work/ch250798       #where your fasta file is
awk '{print $1 "\n" $2}' my_sequences.fasta > my_sequences_fixed.fasta
head my_sequences.fasta 
#if it is in two lines as instructed before: then delete my_sequences.fasta file and rename my_sequences_fixed.fasta to my_sequences.fasta

#This will create following files: my_sequences_index.*.bt2

#Aligning Reads with Bowtie2
bowtie2 -x my_sequences_index -U reads.fastq -S output.sam

#if you have R1 & R2 FASTQ files
bowtie2 -x my_sequences_index \
    -1 24235FL-05-02V1-01_S1_L001_R1_001.fastq.gz \
    -2 24235FL-05-02V1-01_S1_L001_R2_001.fastq.gz \
    --very-sensitive-local -S L1.sam

Repeat this for all the files

#Post-alignment: Counting Features
featureCounts -T 4 -a annotation.gtf -o counts.txt output.sam
#-T 4: Uses 4 threads (adjust based on your system).
#-a annotation.gtf: Needs a GTF annotation file (if available).
#-o counts.txt: Saves the output count table.

#HTSeq-Count
htseq-count -f sam -s no output.sam annotation.gtf > counts.txt
#-f sam: Specifies SAM format.
#-s no: If your data is not strand-specific

#Final Step: Analyze Expression
#Now that you have a counts.txt file, you can:
#Use R (Seurat, DESeq2, EdgeR) to analyze gene expression.
#Convert the output to a CSV for Excel (awk '{print $1","$2}' counts.txt > counts.csv).
